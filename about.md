## The Issue

Environmental data science (EDS) is a field that has a high barrier to entry, particularly for marginalized communities. The high entry barrier negatively impacts our ability to attract and retain a diverse EDS workforce.
Within EDS, there is a lack of centralized resources and career guidance for individuals entering the field.

## The Solution

Compile resources and create an infrastructure to support an environmental data science mentorship program focused on university students.

## Getting MEnDS Off the Ground

1. Gather mentors: Start with a google form for attendees of this NCEAS summit to fill out (on a volunteer basis) to gauge interest. Spread this form through many EDS communicative channels (EcoDataScience Slack, university listservs, etc.)
2. Establish a steering committee for the development and organization of the program guidelines.
3. Secure a funding source to support the development of the website or resource (non-profit organization?)
4. Build the program (pending funding): Compile resources specific to EDS that will facilitate the mentor-mentee relationships, build the web infrastructure to support mentorship, and provide mentor trainings

# Program Features

1. Establish connections with mentee populations: Disseminate resource to university departments, academic advisors, presence at conferences, etc. with a focus on underserved groups.
2. Pairing mentors and mentees: Facilitate face-to-face interviews between mentees interested in pairing with a particular mentor. Clearly communicate that the mentee is able to choose their mentor.
3. Support mentors: Establish a contract between the mentor and mentee with clearly defined expectations with incentives for regular check-ins between mentor/mentee (small personal stipends, research support, organizational recognition for mentor, etc.)
4. Evaluate performance by periodically asking mentees (anonymously?) if and how they have benefitted from the program.
